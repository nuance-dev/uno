## üíª Get it

Download from the [releases](https://github.com/nuance-dev/Uno/releases/) page.

## üîí Security

- Each piece is individually encrypted using AES-GCM encryption
- Unique salt and key derivation for each piece
- Original file can only be recovered with all 3 pieces
- Two modes available:
  - **Standard Mode**: Basic file splitting with LZFSE compression
  - **Secure Mode**: Adds military-grade encryption to each piece
- Perfect for distributing sensitive files across different channels

### How Secure Mode Works

- Each piece is independently encrypted using AES-GCM
- Keys are derived using HKDF with SHA-256
- Unique salt generated for each piece
- Key material is derived from the original file's hash
- Without all three pieces and the original file hash, decryption is computationally infeasible
